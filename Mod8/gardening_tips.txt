Know Your Plants' Needs
Different plants need different amounts of sunlight, water, and nutrients. Group plants with similar needs together to make care easier and prevent over- or under-watering.

Feed the Soil, Not Just the Plants
Healthy soil is the foundation of a thriving garden. Add compost or organic matter regularly to improve soil structure, drainage, and nutrient content.

Water Early in the Morning
Watering early reduces evaporation and allows plants to absorb moisture before the heat of the day. It also helps prevent fungal diseases that thrive in wet, cool conditions overnight
